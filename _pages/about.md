description: The word "Praxis" refers to a process whereby an idea or theory is applied in the real world. At the heart of this idea is a focus on integrating theory and practice.

When it comes to the activity of armwrestling, we live for the ***act itself***, whether it's a casual match at a bar, an intense practice session, or the highest levels of competition. 

It's these simple moments—when we actually get to put our elbow on the table, grip up with our opponent, and rip—that capture the unique and powerful appeal of the activity, constituting the most important part of Praxis: **participation**.


For the serious competitor, however, the space between bouts of participation allows an opportunity for reflection, where we sink deep into our thoughts and ask, 

> How can I get better? How can I get stronger? Where should I focus my efforts?

The process of finding the answers to these questions shape the majority of our training and preparation efforts, completing the other half of Praxis: **reflection, theory and understanding**. 

As armwrestlers, we are practitioners first and foremost, but we also understand that the path to greatness demands a continuous process of acquiring and applying new knowledge.


**Armwrestling Praxis was created to address  and fuse both sides of this process: to unite reflection and participation -- theory and practice -- through  engaging, informative, and value-rich content that educates the wider armwrestling community and inspires action and application above all else.** 

This site, then,  is a place where armwrestlers of all experiences levels can find  answers to their questions regarding any and all aspects of the sport. 

Whether you are a hobbyist, enthusiastic beginner, or seasoned pro, my hope for you is that Armwrestling Praxis can serve as a reliable source of support and guidance along your armwrestling journey.
